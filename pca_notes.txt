# Some notes on adding PCA principal components back to the original dataframe.

df = whatever data you loaded

# do pca stuff
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df.select_dtypes(include=['float']))
pca_projection = pca.fit_transform(X)

# combine pc vals back with original df

# first, use first three principal components as a dataframe
principalDf = pd.DataFrame(data = pca_projection[:,:3], columns = ['pc1', 'pc2','pc3'])

# then, add pcs to original df
df['pc1'] = pca_projection[:,0] # first PC
df['pc2'] = pca_projection[:,1] # second PC
df['pc3'] = pca_projection[:,2] # third PC
# ^ you can add as many as you want!

# now you can plot stuff using these new columns of `df` as x and y coords!
